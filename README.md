It's an attempt to dig into the depths of his existence, the most private parts of his mind and share them with whomever wishes to listen.  It's an open diary or notebook you might stumble across in his bedroom.  It's intimate and warm and raw and beautiful! To keep in the spirit of the songs he's been touring in people's bedrooms across the US and Canada.  This is the first solo public performance (not in a bedroom) he has ever played in Toronto.  It is the Toronto Release Celebration of a decade of writing and playing and thinking about this project.  Come celebrate and see these little notes from an attic bedroom shake the walls of the legendary Horseshoe Tavern! |
