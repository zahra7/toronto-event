### Jiggle Ball - A Jello-Shot Cocktail Competition
<a name="jiggle-ball---a-jello-shot-cocktail-competition"></a>
Announcing the First Annual Jiggle Ball.¬†  What is Jiggle Ball? Quite simply, it‚Äôs a two-stage jello-shot competition. Now is the time to flex all of that knowledge and expertise in a whole new medium: a medium that bridges the solid and the liquid, one that readily incorporates and celebrates colour, one that shuns the current trend of stiff, high octane cocktails and, instead, insists on a lower ABV. We know "Toronto's Jello-Shot Champion" is a title you didn't know you needed to claim, but we have a feeling you do now.¬†  ALL PROCEEDS from the bar, door and raffle will be going directly to Nellies Women‚Äôs Shelter (www.nellies.org). There will amazing¬†music by three of the best female DJS in the city: Sophie Jones, JMKM, Gimmemar. There will be kitschy 50s style canap√©s. There will be inexpensive and tasty drinks donated by Ace Hill, Sweetgrass and Corbys Spirits & Wine. There will be raffles and prizes. There will be nice people. There will be a lot of jello.¬†  Modeled after many of the finest competitions, this will be a two-stage competition. We will announce the prize at a later date but it will be terrific. The best prize. Everybody says so.  While the judging will be top-notch, this will be a market-style competition: informal with all of our family and friends able to walk around and try different competing entries. There will be a separate ‚Äòpeoples choice‚Äô award based on the votes of the discerning public. So even if you lose on merit, you can always win on popularity. Which is kind of like life to be honest.  You can enter by emailing Christina at jiggleballto@gmail.com . Every entrant will receive a $30 LCBO gift card AND your choice of the finest McGuinness products 1) to help offset the cost of entering and experimenting. You don‚Äôt need to submit a cocktail recipe with your entry, all we need to know is your establishment/team. DEADLINE for throwing your hat in the ring is November 24, 2016 at 5pm.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, this will be a fun party where ALL THE PROCEEDS will be going to Nellies Women‚Äôs Shelter. As we all know, holiday seasons can exacerbate existing tensions in families and relationships. At-risk women are often torn between trying to 'make it work' and stay at 'home during the holidays' and seeking a truly safe environment for both themselves (and their children, if they exist.) Moreover, women's shelters across the country routinely report a lower occupancy rate over Christmas with a spike in clients (a preferred word) on December 27/28 that continues through the New Year. It is my belief that the human spirit not only needs nourishment and shelter but regular opportunities for joy. Any extra funds that we can all provide for the shelter to create a comfortable and enjoyable holiday season/birthdays/etc can already help uplift these ladies' spirits.  At the end of the day, the women who have chosen to leave an abusive and life-threatening environment for change are very strong individuals who need our praise and support rather than our pity. Our hope is to use our time and community of friends and loved ones to uplift them.    DA RULEZ  Competition #1 ‚Äì Semi-Blind Tasting (20 points)  Each competing team will be required to nominate one member to participate. Each competitor will be given a box with 5 jell-o shots, all modeled off of well-known standard and modern classic cocktails. All competitors will receive the same blind box of shots. The task is to properly identify the cocktail off of which each cocktail is based. There will be a list of cocktails to choose from. Each correctly identified shot will gain each team 4 points to a maximum of 20.  Competition #2 ‚Äì Cocktail Competition (80 points)  Prior to the competition, each competing team will be given a $30 LCBO gift card and their choice of the finest McGuinness productsto help offset the cost of entering.  Each team will be required to make 50 portions of their cocktail. The cocktail must adhere to the following rules:  1) It must be set. It can be set using gelatin, agar agar or the substance of your choice. A non-set entry will automatically be disqualified. So if you have a really rad bubble-tea inspired drink, save it for Diageo World Class. 2) It must jiggle when lightly poked. 3) Any brand or type of consumable alcohol is allowed. Wine, beer, sake, spirit, etc. As long as it is alcoholic. NB It does not need to meet a minimum abv, it just has to have some. 4) No component can cost more than $60 a bottle at the LCBO. If your team decides that it can‚Äôt balance a jell-o shot without the addition of some rare sherry, just go home and re-evaluate your life choices. 5) It can be no more than a mouth-full. This is a ‚Äòshot‚Äô completion. If you have to take multiple bites to get through it, it's dessert. 6) Any shape or vessel is allowed. Objects are allowed to be submerged in the shot as long as they themselves are edible and food-safe.   ***Bonus Points*** (5 points each)  *Does it have 3 or more layers? *If it is set on fire for 3 seconds, is it still set after the flame is extinguished? *Does it glow in the dark? *Does it clearly reference a classic 90's shooter?

### Album Release Celebration - Greg Halpin's &quot;Notes From a Bedroom&quot;
<a name="album-release-celebration---greg-halpins-&quot;notes-from-a-bedroom&quot;"></a>
Greg Halpin (Honheehonhee, Lakes of Canada) recorded "Notes From a Bedroom" with the help of Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire, Leonard Cohen) on cassette tapes in his bedroom in Montreal.  It's an attempt to dig into the depths of his existence, the most private parts of his mind and share them with whomever wishes to listen.  It's an open diary or notebook you might stumble across in his bedroom.  It's intimate and warm and raw and beautiful! To keep in the spirit of the songs he's been touring in people's bedrooms across the US and Canada.  This is the first solo public performance (not in a bedroom) he has ever played in Toronto.  It is the Toronto Release Celebration of a decade of writing and playing and thinking about this project.  Come celebrate and see these little notes from an attic bedroom shake the walls of the legendary Horseshoe Tavern!
Album link: https://greghalpin.bandcamp.com/
Cover: $5 at the door (or FREE in advance, send your name and request to: greghalpinmusic@gmail.com)

### All Paws Rescue Benefit w. By Divine Right, Eamon McGrath &amp; more!
<a name="all-paws-rescue-benefit-w.-by-divine-right,-eamon-mcgrath-&amp;-more"></a>
BANDS RALLY FOR ALL PAWS RESCUE BENEFIT
By Divine Right, Eamon McGrath, Lake Forest, Before The Flood, Savvie
--> Your Favourite Bands Play Their Favourite Covers! <--
Thurs. Dec. 8 @ Horseshoe Tavern
$10 + donation
FIVE beloved Toronto bands are joining forces for one night only to help raise funds and awareness for All Paws Rescue. The night has been brought together by Manitou, Toronto‚Äôs newest independent music company.
Thursday, Dec. 8 at the Horseshoe Tavern will feature the stellar line-up of Eamon McGrath, Lake Forest, Before The Flood, Vancouver transplant Savvie and very special guests By Divine Right - all performing covers of some of their favourite songs. To top the night off, this will be the very last time that By Divine Right will perform their immensely popular song-for-song cover album of Depeche Mode's Speak & Spell - which they have only performed live a handful of times - before they retire the set for good.
All Paws and Manitou will be collecting donations of cans/bags of pet food, litter, new & gently used leashes, collars, cages, crates, beds, etc. or a monetary donation alongside of the $10 ticket price at the door.
All Paws Rescue Group was founded in 2013 by Michelle Borg. Solely funded by donations and supported entirely by the immense help from community volunteers, All Paws has provided urgent care, foster and forever homes to over 500 pets across Toronto‚Äôs GTA.
‚ÄúThrough my work, I‚Äôve learnt a lot about the community and the kindness of strangers,‚Äù says Borg. ‚ÄúI was delighted when Manitou approached me and offered to get some bands together to raise funds and awareness. This will be the first live music event for us so we‚Äôre super excited! It‚Äôs going to be a fantastic night and I can‚Äôt wait to see everyone out at the Horseshoe.‚Äù

About Wine Club
Wine Club is a social event that promotes local entrepreneurs, artists, innovators, and creators. It's not really about wine at all, the name is a long story‚Ä¶ The event is about non-conformity ‚Äì its a different way to spend a Saturday night and it brings together people, ideas, and, of course, wine. All attendees need to bring is a bottle of wine, a $10 ticket (can be purchased in advance) and your amazing personality (or two bottles of wine). Each event is a little different and our goal is to keep the atmosphere fresh and evolving every time. We have live performances, exhibits, demos as well as guest speakers.
